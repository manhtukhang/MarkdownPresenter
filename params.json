{"name":"Markdownpresenter","tagline":"Update: Follow link to recommended fork. For when you're giving a presentation in half an hour, and you haven't got the time to open up keynote...","body":"Notice\r\n======\r\n\r\nPlease go to https://github.com/jsakamoto/MarkdownPresenter for a more up-to-date fork of this app :)\r\n\r\nMarkdown Presenter\r\n==================\r\n\r\nThis is what I use for giving simple, quick-to-produce presentations. Rather than fighting with keynote or powerpoint for hours, I can whip up a presentation in minutes using markdown.\r\n\r\nDemo and usage\r\n--------------\r\nCheck out a demo\r\n[here](http://manhtuvjp.github.io/MarkdownPresenter/Presenter.html).\r\nUse the arrow keys on your keyboard to switch between slides.\r\n\r\nYou can reload the presentation at any time - staying on the same\r\nslide number - by pressing the spacebar.\r\n\r\nInstalling\r\n----------\r\nYou need to install this on a web server, otherwise it won't be able\r\nto open the presentation.md file via AJAX. So, if you're on a Mac,\r\ncopy it to your `~/Sites/MyPresentation` folder. Then open your web\r\nbrowser to http://localhost/~myusername/MyPresentation/Presenter.html.\r\n\r\nOn Linux or Mac you have also likely Python installed and can start\r\nits built-in web server in this directory by running `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`.\r\n\r\nIf you use [IIS](http://www.iis.net/) or [IIS express](http://www.iis.net/learn/extensions/introduction-to-iis-express/iis-express-overview) copy all the MarkdownPresenter files to the webfolder (normally `C:\\Inetpub\\wwwroot\\<SiteFolder>` on IIS and `C:\\Users\\<User>\\Documents\\My Web Sites\\<WebSite>` on IIS express). \r\n\r\nAlso make sure that a MIME mapping for the .md extension is added. Either add the following mimeMap element to the `applicationhost.config` or the `web.config` file:\r\n\r\n    <system.webServer>\r\n      <!-- there might be other configuration here. -->\r\n      <staticContent>\r\n        <!-- there might be other configuration here. -->\r\n        <mimeMap fileExtension=\".md\" mimeType=\"text/plain\" />\r\n      </staticContent>\r\n    </system.webServer>\r\n\r\nMarkdown file\r\n-------------\r\nThe presentation.md file is where you put your presentation. All you need to do to separate slides is a paragraph with an exclamation mark, eg:\r\n\r\n    This is a slide\r\n    Blah blah blah\r\n\r\n    !\r\n\r\n    This is another slide\r\n    Yada yada yada\r\n\r\nHow it works\r\n------------\r\nThe `Presenter.html` fetches the `presentation.md` from the server via\r\nAjax, uses [Showdown.js](https://github.com/coreyti/showdown) to\r\ntransform it into HTML, splits it on `<p>!</p>` into individual\r\nslides, and displays the current slide.\r\n\r\nNote: Showdown\r\n[supports custom extensions](https://github.com/coreyti/showdown#creating-markdown-extensions)\r\nthat can either\r\n[replace](https://github.com/coreyti/showdown#regexreplace) parts of\r\nthe content based on a regular expression or\r\n[transform the whole text](https://github.com/coreyti/showdown#filter).\r\nThere are some\r\n[extensions already available](https://github.com/coreyti/showdown/tree/master/src/extensions),\r\nfor example\r\n[prettify](https://github.com/coreyti/showdown/blob/master/src/extensions/prettify.js)\r\nthat adds support for syntax highlighting or\r\n[support for tables](https://github.com/coreyti/showdown/blob/master/src/extensions/table.js).\r\n\r\nThe current version of the bundled Showdown.js is 0.3.1 from Nov 2012.\r\n\r\nRelated\r\n-------\r\n- [Reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/): full-featured\r\n  HTML+JS presentation framework with support for Markdown in\r\n  individual slides\r\n- [PageDown](http://code.google.com/p/pagedown/wiki/PageDown) - Stack\r\n  Overflow's clone of Showdown\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
